Welcome to Web Hosting 101
Hey everybody!

Welcome to Web Hosting 101!

In this course, I'm going to ease the confusion and pain of buying a great domain name, setting up a hosting account, and associating your domain name & hosting package so that you can get to what's most importantâ€”getting your website live!

I shed light on the process, and by the end of this course, you will have no problem buying a domain name, setting up a hosting package, and getting your website live! I even show you how to set up a Wordpress Blog in less than 5-minutes! (Inspired by Pat Flynn).

Good luck!

Brad
